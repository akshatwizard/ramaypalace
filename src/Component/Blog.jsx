                <p>
                  Ayodhya is a city located in the northern Indian state of
                  Uttar Pradesh. It is situated on the banks of the Sarayu River
                  and is considered to be one of the seven most important
                  pilgrimage sites for Hindus. Ayodhya is best known for the Ram
                  Janmabhoomi temple, which is believed to be the birthplace of
                  Lord Rama, one of the most revered deities in Hinduism.
                  <br />
                  The history of Ayodhya is closely linked to the epic Ramayana,
                  which tells the story of Lord Rama's life and his battle
                  against the demon king Ravana. According to the legend,
                  Ayodhya was ruled by Lord Rama's father, King Dasharatha, and
                  was a prosperous city during his reign.
                  <br />
                  In 1992, the demolition of the Babri Masjid, a mosque that was
                  built on the site believed to be Lord Rama's birthplace, led
                  to widespread communal violence in India. The dispute over the
                  ownership of the land continued for several years until the
                  Indian Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the site should be
                  handed over to a trust to build a Hindu temple, while a
                  separate piece of land should be allocated for the
                  construction of a mosque.
                  <br />
                  Today, Ayodhya is a major pilgrimage site and attracts
                  millions of devotees every year, especially during the
                  festival of Diwali, which celebrates Lord Rama's return to
                  Ayodhya after defeating Ravana. The city is also home to
                  several other important Hindu temples, such as the Hanuman
                  Garhi temple and the Kanak Bhawan temple.
